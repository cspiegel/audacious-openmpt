[This will no longer be receiving updates, because it has been
integrated into the official audacious-plugins, and will continue to be
maintained there.]

This is a libopenmpt-based module plugin for the Audacious media player.

To build, both libopenmpt (http://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/) and
audacious are required.  For vendors who create separate development
versions of packages, the development versions of both libraries are
required.  These will likely have a name like audacious-dev or
audacious-devel.  libopenmpt must be version 0.3 or greater.

GNU make is required, as is a compiler that supports C++11.  Recent
versions of GCC and Clang are both supported.  Other C++11 compilers
should work, too, but may require the tweaking of compiler.mk.

Once dependencies are installed, build as follows:

$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Audacious's input plugin directory.  To
install to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/staging
